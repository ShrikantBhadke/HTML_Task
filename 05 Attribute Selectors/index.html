    <div>
      <p>A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.</p>
      <p>There are four different combinators in CSS:</p>
      <ol type="I">
        <li>descendant selector (space)</li>
        <li>child selector (>)</li>
        <li>adjacent sibling selector (+)</li>
        <li>general sibling selector (~)</li>
      </ol>
      <span class="title">Descendant Selector</Span>
      
      <p class="title">The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.</p>
      <span>Child Selector</span>
      <p>The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.</p>		
    </div>
    <div class= "adjacent">
      <span>Adjacent Sibling Selectors(+)</span>
      <p>The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is directly after another specific element.
      <br>
      Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately following".</p>
      <span>General Sibling Selector (~)</span>
      <p>The general sibling selector selects all elements that are next siblings of a specified element.</p>
      
    </div>
    <div class ="general">
      <div>
      <p>	A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.</p>
      </div>
      <p>A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.</p>
